Inspired by the old Firefox add-on [Browsizer]

After upgrading to Firefox 57, I could no longer use Browsizer, and no suitable repalcements were available.  So I decided to learn how to write an add-on using the WebExtensions API, and here's what I have come up with so far!

The latest release version is available on [the AMO site].
